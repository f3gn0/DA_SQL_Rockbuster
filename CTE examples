    FROM Customer A
    JOIN Address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    JOIN City C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    JOIN Country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
    GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.City, D.country
    ORDER BY TotalAmount DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
SELECT 
    AVG(TotalAmount) AS average_top5_payment
FROM top_customers;

Write a SQL query to find out how many of the top 5 customers you identified in exercise 3.08 step 1 are based within each country using CTE:

WITH top_customers AS (
    SELECT
        A.customer_id,
        D.country,
        SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount
    FROM Customer A
    JOIN Address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    JOIN City C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    JOIN Country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    JOIN Payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
    GROUP BY A.customer_id, D.country
    ORDER BY total_amount DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
SELECT
    D.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tc.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
JOIN Address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
JOIN City C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
JOIN Country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_customers tc ON D.country = tc.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC;
